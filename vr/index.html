                        <p>Interested in working with virtual reality?</p>
                        <p>
                            Faculties across UBC are getting involved with VR in the
                            classroom and in their field (think anywhere from linguistics
                            to geography to math). The integration of VR into education
                            is just beginning and AGDA wants students involved in this
                            effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>We are calling out to anyone who is interested in VR development!</p>
                        <p>
