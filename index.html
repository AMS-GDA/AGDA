We&#39;re the AMS-GDA, a student run game design team here at the UBC. Every year, we get together and make a new game, mixing in our collective creative efforts to make a fun, engaging game that&#39;s hard to put down. We work towards expanding our knowledge of the tools, techniques, and processes used in video game development. Speakers from the industry also come in and do Q&amp;As. We even host mini Game Jams every year.</p>
